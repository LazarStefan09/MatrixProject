# MatrixProject
**You need the following items in order to implement this project :**
* 8x8 Matrix
* 16x2 LCD
* Joystick
* 10k Ohm resistor
* 220 Ohm resistor
* Arduino Uno
* Breadboard and a mini breadboard
* 10 uF condensator
* 0.1 uF condensator

**How to play the game ?**
In order to start the game, you have to move the joystick to the right.Then, you have to switch the snake's direction towards the food. As you eat, you get bigger and the speed increases.

**My main source of informations is : [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/).**
