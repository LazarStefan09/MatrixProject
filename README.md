* Breadboard and a mini breadboard;
* 10 uF condenser;
* 0.1 uF condenser (100 nF);

**How to play the game ?**
In order to start the game, you have to move the joystick to the right.Then, you have to switch the snake's direction towards the food. As you eat, you get bigger and the speed increases. The goal is to score as many points as you can.
